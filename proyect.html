    <h2><em>(I am still learning how to code, so this might look ugly)</em><h2>
    <p>I want to begin with a list of things I have done in the past days...</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/luisgnava/Da-First-Webpage.git">My First website ever</a>, this is the first website I ever made, and it looks really simple, but I'm really proud of it :D (It's written in English)
      <li><a href="https://github.com/luisgnava/Hello-World.git"> Hello, World!</a>, or maybe this is my first HTML made thing, who knows? (Also in English)
    <h3> An About me section, cool! </h3>
    <p> My name's Luis G. Nava, right now I am 20 years,7 months and some days old? I was too lazy to count.</p>
    <p> I was born on April 10th, and that was a really cold day, or so I heard...</p>
    <p> I studied until High School and then some stuff happened </p>
    <p> My hobbies include reading, playing videogames until my hands <em>bleed</em> and hearing music in high, pitch volume</p>
